          <h2>Early Detection Saves Lives</h2>
          <p>
            Breast cancer is treatable, especially when detected early. Learn
            about symptoms, risk factors, and preventive actions every woman
            should know. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers, but
            when detected early, it can often be treated successfully. Early
            detection through regular screenings like mammograms and self-exams
            helps identify any changes in the breast tissue before symptoms
            become noticeable.

            <h2>What is Breast Cancer?</h2>
            <p>
              Breast cancer occurs when abnormal cells in the breast begin to
              grow uncontrollably. It typically starts in the **ducts** (which
              carry milk to the nipple) or **lobules** (milk-producing glands).
              Over time, these abnormal cells can form a lump or mass and may
              spread to nearby tissues. As the cancer grows, it can invade
              surrounding areas and eventually spread to other parts of the body
              through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. Early detection is
              crucial because it helps prevent the cancer from spreading and
              allows for more effective treatment.

            <h2>What Causes Breast Cancer?</h2>
            <p>
              Several factors can increase the risk of developing breast cancer.
              Genetics, particularly mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, can
              significantly raise the risk. Age is another factor, as the
              likelihood of breast cancer increases as women get older. Hormonal
              changes, such as early menstruation or late menopause, can also
              play a role. Lifestyle factors, including obesity, alcohol
              consumption, and exposure to radiation, can further increase the
              risk. Lastly, having a family history of breast cancer can make
              someone more likely to develop the disease, as genetic mutations
              may be passed down through generations.

            <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
            <p>
              The treatment for breast cancer depends on the type of cancer and
              its stage. For early-stage cancers, surgery is often the primary
              treatment, where the tumor or the entire breast may be removed.
              Chemotherapy is commonly used to target cancer cells throughout
              the body, while radiation therapy helps to eliminate remaining
              cancer cells after surgery. Hormonal therapy can be used for
              cancers that are sensitive to hormones, aiming to block hormone
              production or its effects. Additionally, targeted therapies focus
              on specific molecules involved in cancer growth, while
              immunotherapy helps the body’s immune system recognize and fight
              cancer cells. The choice of treatment varies based on the cancer's
              characteristics and the patient’s overall health.

            <h2>Can It Be Prevented?</h2>
            <p>
              While not all breast cancers can be prevented, the risk can be
              reduced by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Staying active through
              regular exercise, eating a balanced diet rich in fruits,
              vegetables, and whole grains, and limiting alcohol intake can
              lower the risk. Avoiding smoking and reducing exposure to harmful
              chemicals also play a role in prevention. Additionally, regular
              screenings, such as mammograms and self-exams, are crucial for
              early detection, which significantly increases the chances of
              successful treatment. Early detection helps identify cancer before
              symptoms appear, making it easier to treat.
